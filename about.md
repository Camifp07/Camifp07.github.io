## Lifestyle Researches:
Ten years from now, I envision living in a house in Houston, Texas, enjoying a comfortable lifestyle supported by a stable and rewarding career. My ideal transportation would be a luxury vehicle like a Mercedes-Benz G 550, with living expenses including utilities, groceries, entertainment, and health care totaling an estimated \$3,628 per month or \$43,536 annually. To support this lifestyle with a financial cushion, I would need a gross annual salary of at least \$56,596.80. After exploring several career paths, my top choice is to become a Family Physician, a role that combines purpose, stability, and high income. I also considered careers like Physician Assistant, Health Informatics Specialist, and Clinical Laboratory Scientist, each offering different benefits and aligning with my interest in healthcare. The Family Physician role stands out because it allows me to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives while supporting my personal financial and lifestyle goals. Skills I’ve developed in this course — including communication, teamwork, project management, and analytical thinking — will be essential for success in any healthcare environment. Ultimately, my chosen career path will help me achieve a fulfilling life both professionally and personally.
